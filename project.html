    <div class="sentenceImg">
      <img src="/assests/images/Make-Your-Own-Photo-Coffee-Cup.jpg" class="project" alt="Coffee cup making">
      <p class="method">
        Let’s get started! Start by resizing your photo to 3.25″ x 3.25″ (or somewhere around that)
        and print it out onto your photo transfer paper.
        Make sure to mirror the image before printing so it prints backwards and it will look
        correct once you iron it on!! Cut around the photo, leaving a small border around the
        printed area. Print your coffee cozy template as well. I’ve been using the Canon PIXMA
        MegaTank printer for a little while now and love the printing quality. Being able to print photos and create
        projects at home is a huge
        benefit of having a printer, and this one has a huge ink supply, which is an extra bonus!
        Iron your photo onto your white cotton fabric per the paper instructions and peel off the
        backing to reveal the photo underneath. Save the layer you peeled off for a step later on.
        Trim off the fabric sides of the photo so you have a little less than a 1/2″ of fabric on each side of the
        photo. Cut two scraps of fabric for each side that are about 5″ wide each.

    <p class="galHead1">2. DIY POLYMER CLAY BUD VASE..!</p>
    <div class="sentenceImg">
      <img src="/assests/images/pottery-bud.jpg" class="project" alt="christmas gift">
      <p class="method">
        Cut a length of wire to the desired height of your bud vase. Use your fingers and pliers to
        straighten out the wire if need be. Don’t make it too tall or the delicate joints may not
        stay together after repeated use. The length of the wire I used was about 10 inches long.
        Mix together colors of Premo clay to achieve the desired tone. I used mostly white with a
        bit of ecru and gray granite. The gray granite has some speckled texture to it, and the gray
        tones help mute the color of the ecru so it is less flesh toned and more like fired clay.
        There are 25 colors of Premo clay to choose from, so you could really have fun with making
        this craft a fun and bold decor element for your home!
        Premo clay is designed to be firm enough to hold detail work, but it can be a bit stiff when
        you begin working with it. Don’t worry, because the clay softens up quickly from the heat of
        your hands as you work with it. To mix the colors, just keep smashing and twisting the clay
        until the colors are thoroughly combined.

    <p class="galHead1">3. MID-CENTURY MODERN IKEA PLAY KITCHEN HACK..!</p>
    <div class="sentenceImg">
      <img src="/assests/images/Mid-Century-Modern-Ikea.jpg" class="project" alt="christmas gift">
      <p class="method">First, I started by painting the sections of the kitchen the colors that I
        wanted. I found it easier to assemble the bulk of the bottom and top halves first so they
        would stand upright while I painted them and then did the doors and countertop piece
        separately. My first tip for you (that I learned from my mistake) is to try and sand the
        super smooth surface of the kitchen pieces first and then do at least one coat of a good
        primer first before painting. The bottom half that I painted with a regular semi gloss pink
        paint comes off a little easier than I would like compared to the harder drying white lacquer paint that I used
        for the top, and I think a light sanding and a primer would have helped that a lot. I figured the lacquer would
        be more durable,
        so that’s why I used it for the counter area and I think it definitely is a harder coating.

    <p class="galHead1">4. MAKE YOUR OWN FLOWER VASE..!</p>
    <div class="sentenceImg">
      <img src="/assests/images/Llama-Vase-.jpg" class="project" alt="christmas gift">
      <p class="method"> Begin by rolling out a large piece of clay and wrap it around your
        vase so that it is completely covered. Don’t worry about smoothing it out too much at
        this point; you just want to cover the vase and close up the seam by rubbing over it
        and blending the clay.
        Next you will add the features to your llama (a muzzle, cheeks, and ears). These can be
        rough shapes to begin with, but you will want to crosshatch the back of the piece and
        spray it with a bit of water before adhering it to the face.
        This will insure a proper bond between the two pieces and make the vase sturdier.
        Using the water, get your clay wet and start to smooth out your vase and really fine
        tune the features.
        Once your face is finished, let it dry overnight. It will start to crack as it dries
        and the clay contracts. Don’t worry! I have a fix for this! You will need to create a
        slip mixture by mixing a bit of fresh wet clay with water to create a paste. Then use
        this paste to fill in the cracks and smooth out the clay.
        Let dry for a few days until the clay is fully dry.

    <p class="galHead1">5. MODERN HOUSE NUMBER PLANTER..!</p>
    <div class="sentenceImg">
      <img src="/assests/images/door.jpg" class="project" alt="christmas gift">
      <p class="method"> Measure and cut.
        Start by choosing what size you want your sign to be.
        You can customize it for your space, or if it fits, you can make yours exactly the
        same size as ours. Ours is 30″ x 16″ with a 17″ x 5.5″ planter. It’s fairly large,
        but it fits the space nicely. They can cut all the wood pieces for you at the hardware
        store if you don’t have a saw. Just make sure you take correct measurements with you!
        Using wood glue before the nails will create a more secure, sealed box. This is best for
        a planter. Depending on what you plan to plant in it, you can add drainage holes in the
        bottom of the box. We did not. When you attach the box to the front, be sure to drill pilot holes through the
        base.
        This will prevent your wood from splitting. Screw the box on from the back of the base.
        We used the same white paint as the exterior of my house, to match. If your house isn’t white, we suggest bright
        white outdoor paint,
        but you can use any color you like!
